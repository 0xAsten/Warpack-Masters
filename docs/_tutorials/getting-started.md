# Welcome to Warpack Masters!

Warpack Masters is a strategic Backpack management FOC game where you'll build powerful item combinations, battle increasingly difficult opponents, and progress through a unique rebirth system. This tutorial will help you get started with the basics.

## Character Creation

When you first start the game, you'll need to create a character:

1. Choose a name for your character (between 4-12 characters)
2. Select a class for your character, which determines your starting attributes

Each class has different strengths and weaknesses that will influence your playstyle.

## Understanding Your Inventory

After creating your character, you'll start with:

- 2 Backpack items (a Backpack and a Pack)
- Some initial gold to spend in the shop
- Base health and stamina

Your inventory consists of two main areas:
- **Storage**: Where new items are initially placed
- **Grid**: Where you place items to use them in battle

## Placing Your First Items

Place your backpack items first to create space on your grid:

1. Select an item from your storage
2. Choose a location on the grid
3. Set the rotation (0째, 90째, 180째, or 270째)
4. Confirm placement

The backpacks will create enabled grid spaces where you can place other items.

## Item Types

In Warpack Masters, you'll encounter several types of items:

- **Weapons**: Deal damage to enemies
- **Abilities**: Provide special effects
- **Buffs/Debuffs**: Modify stats or apply status effects
- **Backpacks**: Expand your inventory grid

Each item has different properties like width, height, cooldown, and effects.

## Your First Battle

Once you've placed some items in your grid:

1. Click "Fight" to begin the battle

The battle will play out automatically based on the items you've placed and their effects.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, it's time to learn about the [combat system]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/combat-basics) and how different items interact during battle.

Remember:
- You can only fight if you have fewer than 5 losses
- After 5 losses, you'll need to use the rebirth system
- Each victory grants gold and increases your rating

Good luck, and may your strategies lead you to victory!
