# Combat in Warpack Masters

The combat system in Warpack Masters is automated but highly strategic. Your success depends on item placement before the battle begins. This guide explains how combat works.

## How Battles Work

Each battle runs automatically and follows these rules:

1. Battles last up to 25 seconds
2. Items activate based on their cooldown timers
3. Players start with full health and stamina
4. Stamina regenerates at 10 points per second after the first second
5. The winner is the last character standing or whoever has more health when time runs out

## Stamina System

Stamina is a crucial resource:

- Each item activation costs stamina
- If you don't have enough stamina, the item won't activate
- Initial stamina is 100
- Regenerates 10 points per second
- Plan your item cooldowns to maximize stamina efficiency

## Item Activation Types

Items can activate in different ways:

- **On Start**: Effect applies at the beginning of battle
- **On Hit**: Triggers when you're hit by an enemy
- **On Attack**: Triggers when you attack an enemy
- **On Cooldown**: Activates automatically every X seconds

## Status Effects

Combat includes several powerful status effects:

- **Damage**: Directly reduces opponent's health (after armor)
- **Armor**: Absorbs damage until depleted
- **Poison**: Deals 1 damage per stack every 2 seconds
- **Regen**: Heals 1 health per stack every 2 seconds
- **Reflect**: Returns damage when hit by melee weapons (up to 100% of damage)
- **Vampirism**: Heals when dealing damage with melee weapons (up to 100% of damage)
- **Empower**: Increases the damage of weapons

Status effects can stack, so multiple sources of the same effect will combine.

## Combat Example

Here's a simple example of how combat plays out:

1. Battle starts with both fighters at full health
2. Items with "On Start" effects activate immediately
3. Items on cooldown activate when their timer reaches zero
4. Stamina is consumed when items activate
5. Damage, healing, and status effects are applied
6. Battle continues until one fighter is defeated or time runs out

## Tips for Combat Success

- Balance offensive and defensive items
- Consider item cooldowns to maintain steady damage output
- Place items strategically to create synergies
- Watch your stamina consumption - high-cost items might not activate often
- Use status effects like Poison for damage over time
- Build armor to withstand initial enemy attacks

## Winning and Losing

After a battle:

- **Winning** rewards you with 5 gold, increased rating, and potentially health bonuses
- **Losing** gives you 2 gold and decreases your rating
- After 5 losses, you'll need to use the rebirth system
